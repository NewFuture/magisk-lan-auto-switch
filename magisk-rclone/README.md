# Magisk Rclone

This Magisk module integrates `rclone`, a powerful command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It automatically mounts specified directories at boot and provides functionality to unmount them when necessary.

## Features
- Automatically downloads the latest version of `rclone` during installation.
- Checks if `rclone` is running and unmounts all mounts if it is.
- Reads configuration to mount specified directories in daemon mode.
- Ensures mounts are established automatically at boot.

## Installation
1. Download the `magisk-rclone.zip` file.
2. Open the Magisk app.
3. Navigate to the "Modules" section.
4. Tap on "Install from storage" and select the downloaded zip file.
5. Reboot your device to apply the changes.

## Usage
- After installation, the module will automatically mount the specified directories on boot.
- If you need to unmount all mounts, simply restart the device or use the `action.sh` script manually.

## Notes
- Ensure that your configuration for `rclone` is correctly set up before using this module.
- Check the logs for any errors or messages related to the mounting process.

## Debugging
To view logs generated by the module, use the following command in a terminal or ADB shell:

```bash
logcat -s Magisk
```

This will display logs tagged with `Magisk`, including messages from the `action.sh` script.
